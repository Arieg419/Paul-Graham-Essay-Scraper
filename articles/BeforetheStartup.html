October 2014<br/><br/><i>(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman's <a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/">startup class</a> at
Stanford.  It's intended for college students, but much of it is
applicable to potential founders at other ages.)</i><br/><br/>One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give
advice, you can ask yourself "what would I tell my own kids?"  My
kids are little, but I can imagine what I'd tell them about startups
if they were in college, and that's what I'm going to tell you.<br/><br/>Startups are very counterintuitive.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's
just because knowledge about them hasn't permeated our culture yet.
But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you
can't always trust your instincts.<br/><br/>It's like skiing in that way.  When you first try skiing and you
want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back.  But if you lean
back on skis you fly down the hill out of control.  So part of
learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.  Eventually
you get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort.  At
first there's a list of things you're trying to remember as you
start down the hill.<br/><br/>Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for
startups. Here I'm going to give you the first part of it — the things
to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.<br/><br/>
<b>Counterintuitive</b><br/><br/>The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups
are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot
of mistakes.  If you know nothing more than this, you may at least
pause before making them.<br/><br/>When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function
was to tell founders things they would ignore.  It's really true.
Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes
they're about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come
back a year later and say "I wish we'd listened."<br/><br/>Why do the founders ignore the partners' advice?  Well, that's the
thing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions.
They seem wrong.  So of course your first impulse is to disregard
them.  And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse
of Y Combinator but part of its raison d'etre. If founders' instincts
already gave them the right answers, they wouldn't need us.  You
only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That's
why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running
instructors.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>You can, however, trust your instincts about people.  And in fact
one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to
do that enough.  They get involved with people who seem impressive,
but about whom they feel some misgivings personally.  Later when
things blow up they say "I knew there was something off about him,
but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."<br/><br/>If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a
cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you
have misgivings about them, trust your gut.  If someone seems
slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it.<br/><br/>This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with
people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure.<br/><br/>
<b>Expertise</b><br/><br/>The second counterintuitive point is that it's not that important
to know a lot about startups.  The way to succeed in a startup is
not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users
and the problem you're solving for them.
Mark Zuckerberg didn't succeed because he was an expert on startups.
He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because he
understood his users really well.<br/><br/>If you don't know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round,
don't feel bad on that account.  That sort of thing you can learn
when you need to, and forget after you've done it.<br/><br/>In fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary to learn in great
detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat
dangerous.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible
notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I
wouldn't think "here is someone who is way ahead of their peers."
It would set off alarms.  Because another of the characteristic
mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting
a startup.  They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money
at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people.
From the outside that seems like what startups do.  But the next
step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually
realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all
the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing
that's actually essential: making something people want.<br/><br/>
<b>Game</b><br/><br/>We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing
house.  Eventually I realized why it was happening.  The reason
young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is
because that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives
up to that point.  Think about what you have to do to get into
college, for example.  Extracurricular activities, check.  Even in
college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.<br/><br/>I'm not attacking the educational system for being this way. There
will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when
you're being taught something, and if you measure their performance
it's inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point
where much of what you're measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.<br/><br/>I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of
classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape
to make good exam questions.  The way I studied for exams in these
classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught
in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and
work out the answers in advance. When I walked into the final, the
main thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions
would turn up on the exam.  It was like a game.<br/><br/>It's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives
to play such games, young founders' first impulse on starting a
startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new
game. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for
startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the
tricks are for convincing investors.  We tell them the best way to
<a href="convince.html">convince investors</a> is to make a startup
that's actually doing well, meaning <a href="growth.html">growing fast</a>, and then simply
tell investors so.  Then they want to know what the tricks are for
growing fast.  And we have to tell them the best way to do that is
simply to make something people want.<br/><br/>So many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders
begin with the founder asking "How do we..." and the partner replying
"Just..."<br/><br/>Why do the founders always make things so complicated?  The reason,
I realized, is that they're looking for the trick.<br/><br/>So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about
startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops
working.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work
for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can
succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression
of productivity, and so on. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
But that doesn't work with startups.
There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is
whether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal
as physics.  You have to make something people want, and you prosper
only to the extent you do.<br/><br/>The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors.
If you're super good at sounding like you know what you're talking
about, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even two
rounds of funding.  But it's not in your interest to.  The company
is ultimately doomed.  All you're doing is wasting your own time
riding it down.<br/><br/>So stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as
there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less
important than solving the real problem. A founder who knows nothing
about fundraising but has made something users love will have an
easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the
book but has a flat usage graph. And more importantly, the founder
who has made something users love is the one who will go on to
succeed after raising the money.<br/><br/>Though in a sense it's bad news in that you're deprived of one of
your most powerful weapons, I think it's exciting that gaming the
system stops working when you start a startup.  It's exciting that
there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good
work.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all
like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot
of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
I would
have been delighted if I'd realized in college that there were parts
of the real world where gaming the system mattered less than others,
and a few where it hardly mattered at all.  But there are, and this
variation is one of the most important things to consider when
you're thinking about your future.  How do you win in each type of
work, and what would you like to win by doing?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>
<b>All-Consuming</b><br/><br/>That brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are
all-consuming.  If you start a startup, it will take over your life
to a degree you cannot imagine.  And if your startup succeeds, it
will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the
very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working
life.  So there is a real opportunity cost here.<br/><br/>Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects
of it that are unenviable.  Basically at 25 he started running as
fast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn't stopped to
catch his breath since.  Every day new shit happens in the Google
empire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal
with it.  If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week's
backlog of shit accumulates.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly,
partly because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or
weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy
if they talk about having difficult lives.  Which has the strange
side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder
is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.<br/><br/>Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called
big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same
thing.  It never gets any easier.  The nature of the problems change.
You're worrying about construction delays at your London office
instead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment.
But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it
increases.<br/><br/>Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that
it's like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably.
And while it's truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of
things that are easier to do before you have them than after.  Many
of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids. And
since you can delay pushing the button for a while, most people in
rich countries do.<br/><br/>Yet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they're
supposed to start them while they're still in college.  Are you
crazy?  And what are the universities thinking?  They go out of
their way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives,
and yet they're setting up entrepreneurship programs and startup
incubators left and right.<br/><br/>To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here.  A lot
of incoming students are interested in startups.  Universities are,
at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers.  So
students who want to start startups hope universities can teach
them about startups.  And whether universities can do this or not,
there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants
to other universities that do.<br/><br/>Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  They
can teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this
is not what you need to know.  What you need to learn about are the
needs of your own users, and you can't do that until you actually
start the company.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
So starting a startup is intrinsically
something you can only really learn by doing it.  And it's impossible
to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups
take over your life.  You can't start a startup for real as a
student, because if you start a startup for real you're not a student
anymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won't even
be that for long.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take?  Be
a real student and not start a startup, or start a real startup and
not be a student?  I can answer that one for you. Do not start a
startup in college.  How to start a startup is just a subset of a
bigger problem you're trying to solve: how to have a good life.
And though starting a startup can be part of a good life for a lot
of ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it.
Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search.  Most
people should still be searching breadth-first at 20.<br/><br/>You can do things in your early 20s that you can't do as well before
or after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim and travel
super cheaply with no sense of a deadline.  For unambitious people,
this sort of thing is the dreaded "failure to launch," but for the
ambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration.
If you start a startup at 20 and you're sufficiently successful,
you'll never get to do it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.  He
can do other things most people can't, like charter jets to fly him
to foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the serendipity
out of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he's running
Facebook. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a
project you consider your life's work, there are advantages to
serendipity too, especially early in life.  Among other things it
gives you more options to choose your life's work from.<br/><br/>There's not even a tradeoff here. You're not sacrificing anything
if you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you're more likely
to succeed if you wait.  In the unlikely case that you're 20 and
one of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you'll face
a choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run
with it.  But the usual way startups take off is for the founders
to <a href="ds.html">make them</a> take off, and it's gratuitously
stupid to do that at 20.<br/><br/>
<b>Try</b><br/><br/>Should you do it at any age?  I realize I've made startups sound
pretty hard.  If I haven't, let me try again: starting a startup
is really hard.  What if it's too hard?  How can you tell if you're
up to this challenge?<br/><br/>The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell. Your
life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might
be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football
player.  But unless you've had a very strange life you haven't done
much that was <a href="really.html">like</a> being a startup founder.
Starting a startup will change you a lot.  So what you're trying
to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into,
and who can do that?<br/><br/>For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would
have what it took to start successful startups.  It was easy to
tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over
that threshold.  The hard part was predicting how <xa href="relres.html">tough and ambitious</xa></p></font></td></tr></table>
